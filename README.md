# Flavoury

Flavoury is an application that will allow users to search and discover cooking recipes, while offering a personalized experience, based on dietary preferences and food intolerances.

[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), together with the [Material Theme Editor Plugin](https://material.io/resources/theme-editor/), were used for creating the UX flow and UI design for the app. The visual language I've chosen is [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/design/).
